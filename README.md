# Datadog Exercise Solutions

In this directory you can find notebooks containing solutions to the exercises. They were run using Python 3.6. Before running, make sure to install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). In the first notebook, it's assumed that the two data files (`scenario1.txt` and `scenario2.txt`) are located in the same directory as the notebook.
