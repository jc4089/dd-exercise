# Datadog Exercise Solutions

In this directory you can find notebooks containing solutions to the exercises. They were run using Python 3.6. Before running, make sure to install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). Follow these [instructions](https://anbasile.github.io/programming/2017/06/25/jupyter-venv/) for setting up a virtual environment with a Jupyter notebook. In the first notebook, it's assumed that the two data files (`scenario1.txt` and `scenario2.txt`) are located in the same directory as the notebook.
